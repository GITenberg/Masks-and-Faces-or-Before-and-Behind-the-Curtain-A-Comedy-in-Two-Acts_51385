I.</a>—<i>The Green Room of the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden. A Fire-place</i>
<small>C</small>., <i>with a Looking-glass over it, on which a call is wafered. Curtain
rises on Mr. Quin and Mrs. Clive, seated each side of Fire-place.</i></p>

<p>C<small>LIVE</small>. Who dines with Mr. Vane to-day besides ourselves?</p>

<p>Q<small>UIN</small>. His inamorata, Mrs. Woffington, of this theatre.</p>

<p>C<small>LIVE</small>. Of course. But who else?</p>

<p>Q<small>UIN</small>. Sir Charles Pomander. The critics, Snarl and Soaper, are invited,
I believe.</p>

<p>C<small>LIVE</small>. Then I shall eat no dinner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>Q<small>UIN</small>. Pooh! There is to be a haunch that will counterpoise in one hour a
century of censure. Let them talk! the mouth will revenge the ears of Falstaff;—besides,
Snarl is the only ill-natured one—Soaper praises people, don’t he?</p>

<p>C<small>LIVE</small>. Don’t be silly, Quin! Soaper’s praise is only a pin for his
brother executioner to hang abuse on: by this means Snarl, who could not invent even
ill-nature, is never at a loss. Snarl is his own weight in wormwood; but Soaper
is—hush!—hold your tongue.</p>

<p class="entrance">[<i>Enter Snarl and Soaper</i> <small>L</small>.<small>D</small>.
<i>Quin and Clive rise.</i>]</p>

<p class="noindent">(<i>Clive, with engaging sweetness</i>). Ah! Mr. Snarl! Mr. Soaper! we
were talking of you.</p>

<p>S<small>NARL</small>. I am sorry for that, madam.</p>

<p>Q<small>UIN</small>. We hear you dine with us at Mr. Vane’s.</p>

<p>S<small>OAP</small>. We have been invited, and are here to accept. I was told Mr. Vane
was here.</p>

<p>Q<small>UIN</small>. No; but he is on the stage.</p>

<p>S<small>NARL</small>. Come, then, Soaper.</p>

<p class="direction_r">[<i>They move towards door.</i></p>

<p>S<small>OAP</small>. (<i>aside</i>). Snarl!</p>

<p>S<small>NARL</small>. Yes. (<i>With a look of secret intelligence</i>).</p>

<p>S<small>OAP</small>. (<i>crosses slowly to Clive</i>). My dear Mrs. Clive, there was I
going away without telling you how charmed I was with your Flippanta; all that sweetness
and womanly grace, with which you invested that character, was——</p>

<p>S<small>NARL</small>. Misplaced. Flippanta is a vixen, or she is nothing at all.</p>

<p>S<small>OAP</small>. Your Sir John Brute, sir, was a fine performance: you never forgot
the gentleman even in your cups.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>S<small>NARL</small>. Which, as Sir John Brute is the exact opposite of a gentleman, he
ought to have forgotten.</p>

<p class="direction_r">[<i>Exit</i> <small>L</small>.</p>

<p>S<small>OAP</small>. But you must excuse me now; I will resume your praise at
dinner-time.</p>

<p class="direction_r">[<i>Exit, with bows</i>, <small>L</small>.</p>

<p>C<small>LIVE</small> (<i>walks in a rage</i>). We are the most unfortunate of all
artists. Nobody regards our feelings. (<i>Quin shakes his head.</i>)</p>

<p class="entrance">[<i>Enter Call-Boy</i> <small>L</small>.]</p>

<p>C<small>ALL</small>-B<small>OY</small>. Mr. Quin and Mrs. Clive!</p>

<p class="direction_r">[<i>Exit Call-Boy</i> <small>L</small>.</p>

<p>Q<small>UIN</small>. I shall cut my part in this play.</p>

<p>C<small>LIVE</small> (<i>yawns</i>). Cut it as deep as you like, there will be enough
left; and so I shall tell the author if he is there.</p>

<p class="direction_r">[<i>Exeunt Quin and Clive</i> <small>L</small>.</p>

<p class="entrance">[<i>Enter Mr. Vane and Sir Charles Pomander</i> <small>L</small>.]</p>

<p>P<small>OM</small>. All this eloquence might be compressed into one word—you love Mrs.
Margaret Woffington.</p>

<p>V<small>ANE</small>. I glory in it.</p>

<p>P<small>OM</small>. Why not, if it amuses you? We all love an actress once in our
lives, and none of us twice.</p>

<p>V<small>ANE</small>. You are the slave of a word, Sir Charles Pomander. Would you
confound black and white because both are colours? Actress! Can you not see that she is a
being like her fellows in nothing but a name? Her voice is truth, told by music: theirs
are jingling instruments of falsehood.</p>

<p>P<small>OM</small>. No—they are all instruments; but hers is more skilfully tuned and
played upon.</p>

<p>V<small>ANE</small>. She is a fountain of true feeling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>V<small>ANE</small>. She is a divinity to worship.</p>

<p>P<small>OM</small>. And a woman to fight shy of. No—no—we all know Peg Woffington; she
is a decent actress on the boards, and a great actress off them. But I will tell you how
to add a novel charm to her. Make her blush—ask her for the list of your predecessors.</p>

<p>V<small>ANE</small> (<i>with a mortified air</i>). Sir Charles Pomander! But you
yourself profess to admire her.</p>

<p>P<small>OM</small>. And so I do, hugely. Notwithstanding the charms of the mysterious
Hebe I told you of, whose antediluvian coach I extricated from the Slough of Despond, near
Barnet, on my way to town yesterday, I gave La Woffington a proof of my devotion only two
hours ago.</p>

<p>V<small>ANE</small>. How?</p>

<p>P<small>OM</small>. By offering her three hundred a-year—house—coach—pin-money—my
heart——and the et ceteras.</p>

<p>V<small>ANE</small>. You? But she has refused.</p>

<p>P<small>OM</small>. My dear Arcadian, I am here to receive her answer. (<i>Vane crosses
to</i> <small>L</small>.&nbsp;<small>H</small>.) You had better wait for it before making
your avowal.</p>

<p>V<small>ANE</small>. That avowal is made already; but I will wait, if but to see what a
lesson the calumniated actress can read to the fine gentleman.</p>

<p class="direction_r">[<i>Exit</i> <small>L</small>.&nbsp;<small>H</small>.</p>

<p>P<small>OM</small>. The lesson will be set by me—Woffington will learn it immediately.
It is so simple, only three words, <i>£. s. d.</i></p>

<p>T<small>RIPLET</small> (<i>speaking outside</i>). Mr. Rich not in the theatre? Well, my
engagements will allow of my waiting for a few minutes. (<i>Enter Triplet and Call-Boy</i>

Heaven forgive me for raising groundless expectations!</p>

<p>T<small>RIP</small>. Mr. Triplet.</p>

<p>C<small>ALL</small>-B<small>OY</small>. Triplet! There is something left for you in the
hall, sir.</p>

<p class="direction_r">[<i>Exit Call-Boy</i> <small>L</small>.</p>

<p>T<small>RIP</small>. I knew it, I sent him three tragedies. They are accepted; and he
has left me a note in the hall, to fix the reading—at last. I felt it must come, soon or
late; and it has come—late. Master of three arts, painting, writing, and acting, by each
of which men grow fat, how was it possible I should go on perpetually starving. But that
is all over now. My tragedies will be acted, the town will have an intellectual treat, and
my wife and children will stab my heart no more with their hungry looks.</p>

<p>T<small>RIP</small>. (<i>weighs it in his hand</i>). Why, how is this? Oh, I see; he

adopt them, for (<i>opening the parcel</i>) managers are practical men. My tragedies!—Eh?

<p>T<small>RIP</small>. It is, madam (<i>opening his eyes with astonishment</i>); but we
don’t call him Mr., nor even good.</p>

<p>W<small>OFF</small>. Yes; it is Mr. Triplet (<i>shakes both his hands warmly; he
timidly drops a tragedy or two</i>). Don’t you remember a little orange girl at Goodman’s
Fields you used sometimes to pat on the head and give sixpence to, some seven years ago,
Mr. Triplet?</p>

<p>T<small>RIP</small>. Ha! ha! I do remember one, with such a merry laugh and bright eye;

madam, he has blessed me with an excellent wife and three charming children. Mrs. Triplet
was Mrs. Chatterton, of Goodman’s Fields—great in the juvenile parts—you remember her?</p>

<p>W<small>OFF</small>. (<i>very drily</i>). Yes, I remember her; where is she acting?</p>

<p>T<small>RIP</small>. Why, the cares of our family—and then her health (<i>sighs</i>).
She has not acted these eight months.</p>

<p>W<small>OFF</small>. Ah!—and are you still painting scenes?</p>

<p>T<small>RIP</small>. With the pen, madam, not the brush! as the wags said, I have
transferred the distemper from my canvas to my imagination, ha! ha!</p>

<p>W<small>OFF</small>. (<i>aside</i>). This man is acting gaiety. And have your pieces
been successful?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>T<small>RIP</small>. Eminently so—in the closet; the managers have as yet excluded them
from the stage.</p>

<p>W<small>OFF</small>. Ah! now if those things were comedies, I would offer to act in one
of them, and then the stage door would fly open at sight of the author.</p>

<p>T<small>RIP</small>. I’ll go home and write a comedy (<i>moves</i>).</p>

<p>W<small>OFF</small>. On second thoughts, perhaps you had better leave the tragedies
with me.</p>

<p>T<small>RIP</small>. My dear madam!—and you will read them?</p>

<p>W<small>OFF</small>. Ahem! I will make poor Rich read them.</p>

<p>T<small>RIP</small>. But he has rejected them.</p>

<p>W<small>OFF</small>. That is the first step—reading comes after, when it comes at
all.</p>

<p>T<small>RIP</small>. (<i>aside</i>). I must fly home and tell my wife.</p>

<p>W<small>OFF</small>. (<i>aside</i>). In the mean time I can put five guineas into his
pocket. Mr. Triplet, do you write congratulatory verses—odes—and that sort of thing?</p>

<p>T<small>RIP</small>. Anything, madam, from an acrostic to an epic.</p>

<p>W<small>OFF</small>. Good, then I have a commission for you; I dine to-day at Mr.
Vane’s, in Bloomsbury Square. We shall want some verses. Will you oblige us with a
copy?</p>

<p>T<small>RIP</small>. (<i>aside</i>). A guinea in my way, at least. Oh, madam, do but
give me a subject.</p>

<p>W<small>OFF</small>. Let’s see—myself, if you can write on such a theme.</p>

<p>T<small>RIP</small>. ’Tis the one I would have chosen out of all the heathen mythology;
the praises of Venus and the Graces. I will set about it at once (<i>takes up
portrait</i>).</p>

<p>W<small>OFF</small>. (<i>sees picture</i>). But what have you there? not another
tragedy?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>T<small>RIP</small>. (<i>blushing</i>). A poor thing, madam, a portrait—my own
painting, from memory.</p>

<p>W<small>OFF</small>. Oh! oh! I’m a judge of painted faces; let me see it.</p>

<p>T<small>RIP</small>. Nay, madam!</p>

<p>W<small>OFF</small>. I insist! (<i>She takes off the baize.</i>) My own portrait, as I
live! and a good likeness too, or my glass flatters me like the rest of them. And this you
painted from memory?</p>

<p>T<small>RIP</small>. Yes, madam; I have a free admission to every part of the theatre
before the curtain. I have so enjoyed your acting, that I have carried your face home with
me every night, forgive my presumption, and tried to fix in the studio the impression of
the stage.</p>

<p>W<small>OFF</small>. Do you know your portrait has merit? I will give you a sitting for
the last touches.</p>

<p>T<small>RIP</small>. Oh, madam!</p>

<p>W<small>OFF</small>. And bring all the critics—there, no thanks or I’ll stay away.
Stay, I must have your address.</p>

<p>T<small>RIP</small>. (<i>returning to her</i>). On the fly leaf of each work, madam,
you will find the address of James Triplet, painter, actor, and dramatic author, and Mrs.
Woffington’s humble and devoted servant. (<i>Bows ridiculously low, moves away, but
returns with an attempt at a jaunty manner.</i>) Madam, you have inspired a son of Thespis
with dreams of eloquence; you have tuned to a higher key a poet’s lyre; you have tinged a
painter’s existence with brighter colours; and—and—(<i>gazes on her and tries in vain to

yours.</p>

<p>W<small>OFF</small>. I wish I could part with them all.</p>

<p>P<small>OM</small>. Nay, this is a most original admirer, Ernest Vane, that pastoral
youth who means to win La Woffington by agricultural courtship, who wants to take the star
from its firmament, and stick it in a cottage.</p>

<p>W<small>OFF</small>. And what does the man think I am to do without this (<i>imitates
applause</i>) from my dear public’s thousand hands.</p>

<p>P<small>OM</small>. You are to have that from a single mouth instead (<i>mimics a
kiss</i>).</p>

<p>W<small>OFF</small>. Go on, tell me what more he says.</p>

<p>P<small>OM</small>. Why, he——</p>

<p>W<small>OFF</small>. No, you are not to invent; I should detect your work in a minute,
and you would only spoil this man.</p>

<p>P<small>OM</small>. He proposes to be your friend, rather than your lover; to fight for
your reputation instead of adding to your éclat.</p>

<p>W<small>OFF</small>. Oh! and is Mr. Vane your friend?</p>

<p>P<small>OM</small>. He is!</p>

<p>W<small>OFF</small>. (<i>with significance</i>). Why don’t you tell him my real
character, and send him into the country again!</p>

<p>P<small>OM</small>. I do; but he snaps his fingers at me and common sense and the
world:—there is no getting rid of him, except in one way. I had this morning the honour,
madam, of laying certain propositions at your feet.</p>

<p>W<small>OFF</small>. Oh, yes, your letter, Sir Charles (<i>takes it</i> <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-12">[Pg 12]</a></span><i>out of her

“a country house,” “pin-money.” Heigh ho! And I am <i>so</i> tired of houses, and coaches,
and pins. Oh, yes, here <i>is</i> something. What is this you offer me, up in this
corner?</p>

<p class="direction_c">[<i>They inspect the letter together.</i>]</p>

<p>P<small>OM</small>. That,—my “heart!”</p>

<p>W<small>OFF</small>. And you can’t even write it; it looks just like “earth.” There is
your letter, Sir Charles.</p>

<p class="direction_c">[<i>Curtseys and returns it; he takes it and bows.</i>]</p>

<p>P<small>OM</small>. Favour me with your answer.</p>

<p>W<small>OFF</small>. You have it.</p>

<p>P<small>OM</small>. (<i>laughing</i>). Tell me, do you really refuse?</p>

<p>W<small>OFF</small>. (<i>inspecting him</i>). Acting surprise? no, genuine! My good
soul, are you so ignorant of the stage and the world, as not to know that I refuse such
offers as yours every week of my life? I have refused so many of them, that I assure you I
have begun to forget they are insults.</p>

<p>P<small>OM</small>. Insults, madam! They are the highest compliment you have left it in
our power to pay you.</p>

<p>W<small>OFF</small>. Indeed! Oh, I take your meaning. To be your mistress could be but
a temporary disgrace; to be your wife might be a lasting discredit. Now sir, having played
your rival’s game——</p>

<p>P<small>OM</small>. Ah!</p>

<p>W<small>OFF</small>. And exposed your own hand, do something to recover the reputation
of a man of the world. Leave the field before Mr. Vane can enjoy your discomfiture, for
here he comes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>P<small>OM</small>. I leave you, madam, but remember, my discomfiture is neither your
triumph, nor your swain’s.</p>

<p class="direction_r">[<i>Exit</i> <small>L</small>.</p>

<p>W<small>OFF</small>. I do enjoy putting down these irresistibles.</p>

<p class="noindent">At last! I have been here so long.</p>

<p>V<small>ANE</small>. Nothing.</p>

<p>W<small>OFF</small>. Never try to conceal anything from me. I know the map of your
face. These fourteen days you have been subject to some adverse influence; and to-day I
have discovered whose it is.</p>

<p>V<small>ANE</small>. No influence can ever shake yours.</p>

<p>W<small>OFF</small>. Dear friend, for your own sake, not mine; trust your own heart,
eyes, and judgment.</p>

<p>V<small>ANE</small>. I do. I love you; your face is the shrine of sincerity, truth, and
candour. I alone know you: your flatterers do not—your detractors—oh! curse them!</p>

<p>W<small>OFF</small>. You see what men are! Have I done ill to hide the riches of my
heart from the heartless, and keep them all for one honest man, who will be my friend, I
hope, as well as my lover?</p>

<p>V<small>ANE</small>. Ah, that is my ambition.</p>

<p>W<small>OFF</small>. We actresses make good the old proverb, “Many lovers, but few

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>V<small>ANE</small>. I will. Then tell me the way for me, unequal in wit and address to
many of your admirers, to win your esteem.</p>

<p>W<small>OFF</small>. I will tell you a sure way; never act in my presence, never try to
be very clever or eloquent. Remember! I am the goddess of tricks: I can only love my
superior. Be honest and frank as the day, and you will be my superior; and I shall love
you, and bless the hour you shone on my artificial life.</p>

<p>V<small>ANE</small>. Oh! thanks, thanks, for this, I trust, is in my power!</p>

<p>W<small>OFF</small>. Mind—it is no easy task: to be my friend is to respect me, that I
may respect myself the more; to be my friend is to come between me and the temptations of
an unprotected life—the recklessness of a vacant heart.</p>

<p>V<small>ANE</small>. I will place all that is good about me at your feet. I will
sympathize with you when you are sad; I win rejoice when you are gay.</p>

<p>W<small>OFF</small>. Will you scold me when I do wrong?</p>

<p>V<small>ANE</small>. Scold you?</p>

<p>W<small>OFF</small>. Nobody scolds me now—a sure sign nobody loves me. Will you scold
me?</p>

<p>V<small>ANE</small> (<i>tenderly</i>). I will try! and I will be loyal and frank. You
will not hate me for a confession I make myself? (<i>agitated.</i>)</p>

<p>W<small>OFF</small>. I shall like you better—oh! so much better.</p>

<p>V<small>ANE</small>. Then I will own to you——</p>

<p>W<small>OFF</small>. Oh! do not tell me you have loved others before me; I could not
bear to hear it.</p>

<p>V<small>ANE</small>. No—no—I never <i>loved</i> till now.</p>

<p>W<small>OFF</small>. Let me hear that only. I am jealous even <span class="pagenum"><a
class="newpage" id="page-15">[Pg 15]</a></span>of the past. Say you never loved but
me—never mind whether it is true—say so;—but it is true, for you do not yet know love.
Ernest, shall I make you love me, as none of your sex ever loved? with heart, and brain,
and breath, and life, and soul?</p>

<p>V<small>ANE</small>. Teach me so to love, and I am yours for ever. (<i>Pause</i>) And
now you will keep your promise, to make me happy with your presence this morning at the
little festival I had arranged with Cibber and some of our friends of the theatre.</p>

<p>W<small>OFF</small>. I shall have so much pleasure; but, <i>àpropos</i>, you must
include Snarl and Soaper in your list.</p>

<p>V<small>ANE</small>. What! the redoubtable Aristarchuses of the pit?</p>

<p>W<small>OFF</small>. Yes. Oh, you don’t know the consequences of loving an actress. You
will have to espouse my quarrels, manage my managers, and invite my critics to dinner.</p>

<p>V<small>ANE</small>. They shall be invited, never fear.</p>

<p>W<small>OFF</small>. And I’ve a trust for you; poor Triplet’s three tragedies. If they

Burdock—(<i>Burdock fidgets, turning the letters on the salver</i>) when I say you

<p>C<small>OL</small>. James Burdock, property has its duties, as well as its rights.
Master enjoys the rights in town, and mistress discharges the duties in the country; ’tis
the division of labour—and now vanish, honest James, the company will be here directly,
and you know master can’t abide the smell of the stable (<i>crosses to</i>

Vane, James; but I must remember what’s due to myself—I shan’t take it.</p>

<p>S<small>NARL</small>. And the crustier he gets.</p>

<p>S<small>OAP</small>. Delicious! He alludes to Mr. Cibber’s little irritability.</p>

our friend’s hands?</p>

dame Best (that’s his old nurse, Lady Lurewell) has had soup and pudding from the hall
every day.</p>

<p>M<small>ABEL</small>. No—no—no! (<i>stops her ears.</i>) Mr. Vane intended them for a
surprise, and it would spoil his pleasure were I to hear them from you.</p>

<p>T<small>RIP</small>. (<i>sighs</i>). As you please, madam! But you would have liked
them, for the theme inspired me. The kindest, the most generous and gifted of women!—don’t
you agree with me, madam?</p>

<p>M<small>ABEL</small> (<i>laughs</i>). No, indeed!</p>

<p>T<small>RIP</small>. Ah! if you knew her as I do.</p>

<p>M<small>ABEL</small>. I ought to know her better, sir.</p>

be allowed the expression.</p>

<p>M<small>ABEL</small>. Nay, you exaggerate her trifling act of civility.</p>

<p>T<small>RIP</small>. (<i>reproachfully</i>). Act of civility, madam! Why she has saved
me from despair—from starvation perhaps.</p>

<p>M<small>ABEL</small> (<i>aside</i>). Poor thing! how hungry he must have been.</p>

<p>M<small>ABEL</small>. Her portrait! (<i>aside.</i>) Oh, another attention of
Ernest’s—but I thought you were a poet, sir?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>M<small>ABEL</small>. Oh, what a clever man! And so Ernest commissioned you to paint
this portrait?</p>

<p>M<small>ABEL</small>. The lady? (<i>Rises</i>).</p>

<p>T<small>RIP</small>. I expected to find her here;—perhaps you can inform me whether she
is arrived?</p>

<p>M<small>ABEL</small> (<i>aside</i>). Not my portrait after all. Who?</p>

<p>T<small>RIP</small>. Mrs. Woffington.</p>

<p>M<small>ABEL</small>. Woffington? No, there was no such name among the guests Mr. Vane
received to-day.</p>

<p>T<small>RIP</small>. That is strange! She was to be here; and therefore I expedited the
verses in her honour.</p>

<p>M<small>ABEL</small> (<i>ruefully</i>). In <i>her</i> honour?</p>

<p>T<small>RIP</small>. Yes, Madam: the subject is “Genius trampling on Envy.” It
begins—(<i>reads</i>). “When first from Albion’s Isle——”</p>

<p>M<small>ABEL</small>. Nay, I do not care to hear them, for I do not know the lady.</p>

<p>T<small>RIP</small>. Few really know her; but at least you have seen her act.</p>

<p>M<small>ABEL</small>. Act! Is she an actress?</p>

<p>T<small>RIP</small>. <i>An</i> actress, madam! <i>The</i> Actress!—and you have never
seen her! Madam, you have a great pleasure before you; to see her act is a privilege, but
to act with her, as I once did, though she doesn’t remember it—I was hissed, madam, owing
to circumstances which for the credit of our common nature I suppress.</p>

<p>M<small>ABEL</small>. An actor too!</p>

<p>T<small>RIP</small>. And it was in a farce of my own too, madam, which was
damned—accidentally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>M<small>ABEL</small>. And a play-writer?</p>

<p>T<small>RIP</small>. Plays, madam! I have written a library of them; but the madmen who
manage the patent houses won’t act them and make their fortunes. You see in me a dramatic
gold mine, lost because no company will work me.</p>

<p>M<small>ABEL</small>. Yes, yes; but tell me! this actress:—Mr. Vane admires her?</p>

<p>T<small>RIP</small>. Mr. Vane is a gentleman of taste, madam.</p>

<p>M<small>ABEL</small>. And she was to have been here? There were none but persons of
quality—Ah! the news of my intended arrival—no doubt—well Mr.——</p>

<p>T<small>RIP</small>. Triplet, madam! James Triplet, 10, Hercules Buildings, Lambeth:
occasional verses, odes, epithalamia, elegies, dedications, translations, and every
species of literary composition executed with spirit, punctuality, and secrecy. Portraits
painted, and lessons given in declamation and the dramatic art. The card, madam,
(<i>presents card</i>) of him, who, to all these qualifications adds a prouder still—that
of being your humble, devoted, and truly grateful servant—James Triplet (<i>bows and moves
off,—returns</i>). The fact is, madam, it may appear strange to you, but a kind hand has
not so often been held out to me, that I should forget it, especially when that hand is so
fair and gracious as yours. May I be permitted, madam? (<i>puts her hand to his lips</i>,)
you will impute it to gratitude rather than audacity—madam, I am gone—I flatter myself
James Triplet, throughout this charming interview, has conducted himself like what he may
not appear to be—a gentleman.—Madam, I take my final leave.</p>

<p>M<small>ABEL</small>. Invite an actress to his house! but Ernest is so warm-hearted and

A husband with a wife in Huntingdonshire is so like a bachelor.</p>

<p>P<small>OM</small>. And our excellent Ernest is such a favourite.</p>

<p>M<small>ABEL</small>. No wonder.</p>

<p>P<small>OM</small>. There are not many who can so pass in six months from the larva
state of Bumpkin to the butterfly existence of Beau.</p>

<p class="direction_r">[<i>Music ceases.</i></p>

<p>M<small>ABEL</small>. Yes; (<i>sadly</i>) I find him changed.</p>

<p>P<small>OM</small>. Changed? transformed! He is now the prop of the Cocoa-tree—the star
of Ranelagh—the Lauzum of the Green Room.</p>

<p>M<small>ABEL</small>. The green room?</p>

<p>P<small>OM</small>. Ah, I forgot! you are fresh from Eden; the Green Room, my dear
madam, is the bower where fairies put off their wings and goddesses become dowdies—where
Lady Macbeth weeps over her lap-dog’s indigestion, and Belvidera groans over the amount of
her last milliner’s bill. In a word, the Green Room is the place where actors and
actresses become mere men and women, and the name is no doubt derived <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-36">[Pg 36]</a></span>from the general
character of its unprofessional visitors.</p>

<p>M<small>ABEL</small>. And is it possible that Ernest, Mr. Vane, frequents such
places?</p>

<p>P<small>OM</small>. He has earned in six months a reputation that many a fine gentleman
would give his ears for—not a scandalous journal he has not figured in—not an actress of
reputation or no reputation, but gossip has given him for a conquest.</p>

<p>M<small>ABEL</small>. You forget, sir, you are speaking to his wife.</p>

<p>P<small>OM</small>. On the contrary, madam; but you would be sure to learn this, and it
is best you should learn it at once and from a friend.</p>

<p>M<small>ABEL</small>. Is it the office of a friend to calumniate the husband to the
wife?</p>

<p>P<small>OM</small>. When he admires the wife, he reprobates the husband’s ill-taste in
neglecting her.</p>

<p>M<small>ABEL</small>. Do you suppose I did not know of his having invited Mrs.
Woffington to his house to day?</p>

<p>P<small>OM</small>. What! you found her out? you detected the Actress-of-all-work under
the airs of Lady Betty Modish.</p>

<p>M<small>ABEL</small>. Lady Betty Modish!</p>

<p>P<small>OM</small>. Yes; that was La Woffington.</p>

<p>M<small>ABEL</small>. Whom he had invited hither to present her with a copy of
verses.</p>

<p>P<small>OM</small>. Et cetera.</p>

<p>M<small>ABEL</small>. And who in an actress’s sudden frolic, gave herself and her
companions those titles without my husband’s connivance.</p>

<p>P<small>OM</small>. Vane could not have explained it half so well. These women are
incredibles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>M<small>ABEL</small>. Had the visit been in any other character, do you think he would
have chosen for it the day of my arrival?</p>

<p>P<small>OM</small>. Certainly not, if he knew you were coming.</p>

<p>M<small>ABEL</small>. And he did know; why here (<i>seeing letters on table</i>

Wife, our children talk too much; they thrust their noses into everything, and criticise
their own father.</p>

Dumesnil (<i>recites a couple</i> <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"

Woffington was never meant to walk the stage on stilts;—no, let Mrs. Pritchard pledge
Melpomene in her own poison-bowl, I’ll give you Thalia in a bumper of Burgundy. Come,
drink to your new mistress, Triplet (<i>fills her glass</i>). Mrs. Triplet (<i>she rises,
bottle and glass in hand</i>), I must prescribe for you too. A wine glassful of this
<i>elixir</i> six times a day till further notice. Success to your husband’s comedy!
What’s this? (<i>Sees fiddle in cradle</i>). A fiddle, as I’m an ex-orange wench!
(<i>Giving it to Triplet.</i>) Here, Triplet, a jig—a jig. (<i>Triplet takes fiddle.</i>)
Peggy has not forgotten how to cover the buckle. Come, young ones—(<i>Triplet plays. She

Hurroo! (<i>She dances up to Triplet, who, in his excitement, rises and joins in the jig,

Mrs. Triplet, we must clear the studio:—take your cherubs into the bed-room.</p>

like Woffington.</p>

<p>Q<small>UIN</small>. Nay—compare paint with paint, Kitty—who ever saw Woffington’s real
face?</p>

<p>S<small>OAP</small>. Now, I call it beautiful; so smooth, polished, and uniform.</p>

<p>S<small>NARL</small>. Whereas nature delights in irregular and finely graduated
surfaces. Your brush is not destitute of a certain crude talent, Mr. Triplet, but you are
deficient in the great principles of Art; the first of which is a loyal adherence to
truth; beauty itself is but one of the forms of truth, and nature is our finite exponent
of infinite truth.</p>

<p>S<small>OAP</small>. What wonderful criticism! One quite loses oneself among such grand
words!</p>

<p>C<small>IB</small>. Yes, yes! proceed Mr. Snarl. I am of your mind.</p>

<p>S<small>NARL</small>. Now in nature, a woman’s face at this distance, has a softness of
outline—(<i>draws back and makes a lorgnette of his two hands, the others do the
same</i>), whereas your work is hard and tea-boardy.</p>

<p>S<small>OAP</small>. Well it is a <i>leetle tea-boardy</i>, perhaps. But the light and
shade, Mr. Snarl—! the—what-d’ye-call—the—um—you know—eh?</p>

<p>S<small>NARL</small>. Ah! you mean the chiaroscuro.</p>

<p>S<small>OAP</small>. Exactly!</p>

<p>S<small>NARL</small>. The chiaroscuro is all wrong. In nature, <span class="pagenum"><a
class="newpage" id="page-51">[Pg 51]</a></span>the nose, intercepting the light on one
side the face, throws a shadow under the eye. Caravaggio, the Venetians, and the
Bolognese, do particular justice to this—no such shade appears in your portrait.</p>

<p class="direction_c">(<i>All express assent except Soaper.</i>)</p>

<p>S<small>OAP</small>. But, my dear Mr. Snarl, if there are no shades, there are
lights—loads of lights.</p>

<p>S<small>NARL</small>. There are, only they are impossible (<i>superciliously</i>). You
have, however, succeeded tolerably in the mechanical parts—the dress, for example; but
your Woffington is not a woman, Sir—nor nature!</p>

respect, say to me—“do so,” I shall do it (<i>Mabel clasps her hands</i>). There is only
one way—but that way is simple. Mr. Vane thinks better of me than I deserve—I have only to
make him (<i>with a trembling lip</i>) believe me worse than I am, and he will return to
you, and love you better, far better, for having known, admired, and despised, Peg
Woffington.</p>

<p>M<small>ABEL</small>. Oh! I shall bless you every hour of my life (<i>pause</i>). But
rob you of your good name! bid a woman soil her forehead so for me! (<i>sighs, long

heart crushed, but my conscience unstained; for so my humble life has passed till now.</p>

<p>W<small>OFF</small>. Humble! such as you are the diamonds of the world!!! Angel of
truth and goodness, you have conquered! The poor heart we both overrate shall be your’s

<p>V<small>ANE</small> (<i>to Mabel</i>). But this letter?</p>

left-hand glove—that I could bewitch a certain country gentleman’s imagination, though his
heart all the while belonged to its rightful owner, and I have won (<i>sighs</i>).</p>

<p>V<small>ANE</small>. What a dupe I have been—am I enough humiliated?</p>

Huntingdonshire, and leave town and the players to us, who know how to deal with them.</p>

comfort, and I wish you appetite to enjoy it, Mr. Triplet.</p>

<p>T<small>RIP</small>. Am I awake? Pinch me, somebody—(<i>Woffington pinches him</i>)
thank you—I <i>am</i> awake.</p>

<p>C<small>IB</small>. Manager Rich, thanks to Peggy’s influence here, and a good word or
two from one who shall be nameless, has accepted one of your tragedies.</p>

<p>T<small>RIP</small>. Oh, Lord!</p>

<p>S<small>OAP</small>. He! he! I give you joy, Mr. Triplet; Mr. Snarl and I are so glad,
for as Mr. Snarl said to me, as we left your studio this morning, “I do so wish they’d
play one of Mr. Triplet’s tragedies.”</p>

<p>S<small>NARL</small>. That I might have the pleasure of criticising it. Mr. Rich did me
the honour to ask which of the three we should accept—I told him, the shortest.</p>

<p>C<small>LIVE</small>. You’ll be pleased to hear, Mrs. Woffington, there’s a capital
part for <i>me.</i> (<i>Aside</i>) Now she could knock me down, I know.</p>

<p>T<small>RIP</small>. One of my tragedies accepted at last! Oh, gracious goodness! Break
it gently to my wife—I know I’m dreaming, but prithee don’t anybody wake me. Oh, Mrs.
Woffington—my guardian angel—my preserver! (<i>seizes her hand</i>)</p>

<p>W<small>OFF</small>. No, no—we had better wait, and see on which act of your tragedy
the curtain falls.</p>

<p>T<small>RIP</small>. Ah! I forgot that.</p>

<p>M<small>ABEL</small>. I need not wait to express my gratitude—say in what way can I
ever thank you?</p>

<p class="no_bottom">W<small>OFF</small>. Dear sister, when hereafter in your home of
peace you hear harsh sentence passed on us, whose lot is admiration, but rarely love,
triumph but never <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-70">[Pg

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
